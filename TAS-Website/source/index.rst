Welcome to the TAS Battle Website!
===================================

**TAS-Battle** is a Minecraft Mod that allows players to fight in various different gamestyles, while the game is slowed down.
Fights in a slowed down environment are much harder and smarter, since the players have more time to think about what move to do next. 
If you record and speed up the video footage by (20/tickrate) times, you will get insane looking gameplay.
