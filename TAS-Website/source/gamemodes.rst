List of all available gamemodes
===================================

TAS Battle features a lot of different gamemodes which are highly customizable to everyones liking. For us, having the
community take part in the creation of the gamemodes makes it more fun for everone to play.

Skywars
--------
Skywars is a gamemode where players fight on islands. Players can select their start-kits and also find more loot in chests around the islands.

KnockFFA
--------
KnockFFA is a gamemode where you stand on a small strip of land on a floating island and have to punch off your opponents.

FFA
--------
FFA was the first ever gamemode to be played in slowmotion. Everyone fights everyone and the last man standing wins the game.
Players vote for a kit before the game starts and get teleported onto a random map.


Juggernaut
--------
This gamemode works similair to FFA. A random player is chosen to be the juggernaut and his goal is to kill all players to win the game. 
The Juggernaut has better gear and more health but can not regenerate. If the juggernaut dies before all players are killed then the juggernaut loses the game.
